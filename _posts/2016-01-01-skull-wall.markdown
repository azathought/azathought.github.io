Home built skull wall display inspired by [Three Dots](http://threedotschicago.com/) and the decorations at a Guerilla Drinks popup this year in Washington, DC,  Glue gun, plastic skulls from a Halloween store and ribon LED lights.  Looking directly at it was pretty painful, next time Iâ€™ll put this together a bit differently, but it was nice to make some thing physical for a change.
