I learned how to draw, and as a result how to draw women, almost entirely from Stan Lee and John Buscema's ["How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Draw-Comics-Marvel-Way/dp/0671530771/). I'm going to try to reeducate myself for a comics of more modern time. Sketch work is going to start by sight-copying panels from some favorites.  

## Squirrel Girl

This turned out well.  It's not as dynamic as the original, but I think I got the awesomess of the character across.

## Doctor Aphra

This character, a favorite from the new Darth Vader comic and now with her own solo run, is tougher.  In Vader, she was very well written despite having a cliche "evil Han Solo" role and often being drawn for the male gaze.  I like how it turned out, but a poor attempt at foreshortening makes her build look all wrong. Aphra is shorter and the scrolling on this website doesn't help in several ways compared to what I was going for.
