With spouse command out on a girls weekend I took the opportunity to get some home stuff organized and let her come back to a clean house and accomplished feeling (rather than the usual stressed) husband.  I even got some exercise in; a whopping 20 minutes.

I went a bit overboard setting up a bullet journal with all kinds of special sections up in the front for keeping things organized.  The only part that actually helps on paper over my mega-OCD google spreadsheet is the weekend action list to keep on task for the things that need to get done.  

For the bullet journal nerds out there, I'm using a Code and Quill Origin with a leather pen quiver.

I closed out the weekend with an well earned Octoberfest and some sketchwork from Louvre photo refrences.  Sketching is good for the soul.
