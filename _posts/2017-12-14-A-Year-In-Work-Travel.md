I have one more flight in me this year, headed to Los Angeles to see my family for Christmas.  It's been a long year of much work travel, enought to break into the gold status level of an airline for the first time.  I used a website called jetitup.com which can connect to my tripit account to generate some nice visualizations and informatics around that travel.
