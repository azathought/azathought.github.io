Board games are experiencing renaissance, and I have the great pleasure of having a few friends who follow the board game community closely to bring great games into our circle.  Very few if any of these games actually came out in 2017, but I had my first experience with them this year.  This is probably the first year I've really paid attention to which games I enjoy and made a concerted effort to block time in busy adult life for board games with friends.  

So here they are, my top 5 board game experiences of 2017:

### 5) Cyclades

Looking at my shelf of board games purchased over the last several years, it's clear that I'm a fan of the "dudes-on-a-map" take and hold war game genre of board games.  I spent a good time on board game geek and the excellent [Shut Up and Sit Down](shutupandsitdown.com) cruising through reviews and impressions and discovered that there is a trilogy of games from publisher Matagot that I'm very interested to play.  These games, Cyclades, Kamet, and Inis, are popular enough that they go out of print so I grabbed the first in the series that is probably the most traditional.

What makes this game different from main-stream games like Risk or even more modern games like War of the Ring is that the game incorporates bidding mechanics, symmetric map starting positions, and relatively limited play times compared to the 6 hour war-of-attrition slogs common to the genre.

Thematically the game is fantastic, with mythical beats summonings and sway with the pantheon of Greek mythology causing the sweeping changes in map dominance.  This is probably my favorite intro-war game right now.

### 4) Spirit Island

Co-operative games are some of the easiest games to play with friends who aren't as interested in competitive play.  Not everyone is motivated to be the overall "winner" of a game, but even more important when sitting down to a hour+ board game is making sure that each player is having fun for the full play time.  In co-operative games you've taken away a large part of the risk of a game being unbalanced or an inexperienced player effectively being "out of contention" and ineffective for the second part of a game where winners pull away from the pack.

Most of these co-operative games involve the players teaming up against a big-bad such as a monster or a mystery.  Spirit Island turns that assumption on it's head, with the players portraying nature spirits on an island being colonized by European invaders.  This is a co-op worker placement game with a great theme with all the fun of games like Dungeon Keeper where you are the anti-colonial force repelling what are typically the protagonists in euro-games.  

### 3) The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31

John Carpenter's The Thing is one of my favorite movies, so I'm already predisposed to like this game. I had the pleasure of playing a 7 player game this December. The game has a hidden traitor mechanic similar to Werewolf or the Battlestar Galactica game.  Having recent memory of the movie is probably required to enjoy all the game elements and adding gravity to the various win and loss scenarios.  

My table of friends had a debate about whether or not the game would be broken if all the imitations (aliens) played quiet the whole game to all try to be on the helicopter.  While I'm interested in having this kind of play through to find out, I wouldn't be surprised if we only had this impression due to clearing the first few zones of the base so quickly.  If the group had had setbacks early, sabotage might have been a quicker path to victory.  

All the same, our group had a fun first run of this and an excellent ending reveal.  This will likely go into a yearly (cold weather) rotation for that gaming group.

### 2) Captain Sonar

Mechanically, this game was the most innovative game I was introduced to this year.  Two teams of four coordinate the operation of a hidden submarine, each team hunting to destroy the other team.  The game plays out like a very analog Star Trek bridge simulation video game with the players trying to deduce the location of the other ship in real time using a map, a cellophane sheet, and a wet erase marker.  The game is tactile, played in real time, and involves creating non-verbal communication short-hands between a group of four players to out-maneuver the enemy ship.

Exactly eight players is a lot to get to a table, but this game makes it worth it with a short play time, allowing multiple plays through and the accomplishment of shared team improvement in a single night.

This is probably the first team board game I've enjoyed.  

### 1) Cthulhu Wars

With an interesting history from a failed video game kickstarter and the pedigree of being designed by Sandy Petersen, the author of the 1981 Call of Cthulhu RPG, this game is easily the largest "miniatures" game I've ever played.  The monsters are huge and beautifully sculpted!

This game has an asymmetric take-and-hold war game mechanic.  While the board is fairly symmetric in starting position and accessible, no space is really more than two jumps away from any other space, each faction has very different abilities and strategies.  

Cthulhu Wars had all my personal favorites: innovative rules, strong theme from a source material I already like, and some good old dudes-on-a-map fun with a reasonable playtime.  Given that the game is expensive and a bit hard to come by, the rare chance to play it probably added to the enjoyment.
