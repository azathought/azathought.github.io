Board Games.  We love them.  Very few if any of these games actually came out in 2017, but I had my first experience with them this year.  I rely on my friends to bring back the good stuff from conventions and scouring various forums, and try to join as many gaming nights as I host.  So here they are, my top 5 board game experiences of 2017:

### 5) Cyclades

Started it
Trilogy that I'm interested in playing all of it comes back into print

### 4) Spirit Island

Fun powers to explore, deck building components, the theme comes through despite very euro wood components.  The setting is almost entirely in one's head and it works.

### 3) The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31

Well balanced
Theory about all the aliens going for the long game as a way to get on the helicopter?

### 2) Captain Sonar

The first real time mechanic I've enjoyed in a non-coop game.  It has the same pace as Kung-Fu Chess (chess without turns)

### 1) Cthulhu Wars

This might be the largest "miniatures" game I've ever played.
