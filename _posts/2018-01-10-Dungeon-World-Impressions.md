Front Matter paragraph

### Games knowing what they are about

GMs running a creative game in a crunchy system.  Players doing high story in a crunchy system distracting from everything.

Crunch players only really min/maxing by the perceptions of thos who would rather be playing another game

Koebel's theory on why Burning Wheel works and moving that to dungeon world ... in the intro to the book

### One-shot Prep

How much prep to really do in a campaign vs a one shot, and forcing a GM to think on one's feet.  Being honest with myself about where the player flexibility is in a game.

### Collaborative Storytelling

The game will adapt to the needs of the players rather than the other way around?
