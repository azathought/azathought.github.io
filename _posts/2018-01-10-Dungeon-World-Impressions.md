Dungeon world has rules that read like a hidden manifesto for narrative gaming.

## Theory and Regrets

There is an attempt at a game design unified theory out there called [GNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_theory) that tried to explain how games have characteristics that align them towards Gamism, Narrativism, or Simulationism.  Categorizing the things we love is fun meta-hobby to throw ontop of your hobby.  Lately I've come to realize that the fun I've had gaming with others, especially tabletop role playing games has been hugely influenced by whether or not the participants had the same expectation of play style as the rules of the game they we were trying to enjoy.

My main two poor experiences have been when 
1. as GM, when my players keep their [headcanon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Headcanon) on a game to themselves or barely interact with the world around them.
2. as GM, my players are dissapointed in the level of choices they have in character creation and combat and how that impacts the outcome of the game we are playing.

At this point as a GM, the most frequent mistake I make in a game is probably due to a decade of not undestanding the above problem.  I've been playing in systems built for crunch and tactical combat (3rd and 4th ed D&D) and prepping as rich a background world as possible to compensate for the game's lack of tools to make that world interesting.  The impact is that when I switch gears to other systems that don't require a sotry on rails to the same degree that 3rd and 4th did, I am still bringing a story that has an almost predetermined path through a fixed story.  The story may not be linear, but I can predict the ending to 99% of the Cthulhu games I've run, and that feels wrong.

## Enter Dungeon World and the Long Tail

Dugeon World was written in 2012 by Adam Koebel and Sage LaTorra, who were both trying to adapt a Dungeons & Dragons like experience to the "Powered by the Apocalypse" engine.  The writer of Apocalypse World did the RPG equivalent of open sourcing their engine, alowing a [cottage industry of descendent games](http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/) to pop up across a wide range of genres.  Rather than just inject some PbtA concepts into their D&D they found that a full rewrite to a lighter system was necessary.  Koebel describes his thoughts on game design in [his commentary on Burning wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E79DDGdX62I&t=5m35s).  Briefly, a game should know and present the following:
1. **what** the game is about
2. **how** the game is about that above thing
3. and what reward structure exists to encourage player behavior towards that design goal

Or said in another way, the rules of a game should be written to incentivize player behavior that leads to what that game is about.

We exist in the era of the Chris Anderson's [Long Tail](http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html), where the market is moving away from depending on only a few strong "hits" that attract the majority of interest but rather that consumers will seek out the niche products that fit their more narrowly defined interests and the virtually connected communities of the internet can connect those interests such that they can survive.  Dungeon Wolrd would have never survived in the gaming market of 1996.  Back then there could only be a handful of well funded winners.  In the world where the writer of a small press RPG can live off of Twitch and the associated revenue from their web brand, that equation is fundamentally different.

## How is this game Different

The best way to explain the unique qualities of Dungeon Wolrd is to compare it to the system to which it is meant to stand as narritivist alternative, Dungeons and Dragons

**For the players** the biggest difference is the game is not a turn based simulation of combat but rather a story-telling system where you describe what you are doing in relation to the fiction.  The rules will chime in too, but there is no initiative.  There are turns or rounds.   No rules to say whose turn it is to talk.

1. the GM describes the world around you
2. Players say what their characters are thinking, feeling , and doing. Sometimes those descriptions **trigger a move**.
3. Moves call for you to roll to see what happens, at which GM will describe how the situation has changes and ask the question, “what  do you do next?”

Moves are mostly aligned to the 6 main stats causing a of 2d6 + stat mod roll to learn a result which mostly work like this:
* on a 1 through 6 you fail, and suffer the consequences but gain XP
* On a 7 through 9 you succeed but with a complication or cost
* On a 10+ succeed with little trouble

This means that instead of trading blows back and forth and positioning on a grid for advantages, players are narrating a combat which contain anything and then the GM is fitting the outcomes of uncertain parts of that combat into rolls like "hack and slash", a burst of melee combat.  The outcomes deal damage in both directions, yes, but the outcome also alters the narrative causing the player to think of a creative next move or risk a GM "hard move", effectively a free potentially deadly outcome to the player.

**For the GM** the biggest difference is that Dungeon World both requires (and has the capability to survive) some level of unscripted improvisational world creation during play from both the GM and the players.  The game explicitly mandates a system of goals, principles, GM moves, and even a pre-game prep sysgem called **Fronts**, threats in the world that will play into the story.  Fronts focus prep not on the statistics and balance, but rather on opportunities for drama, fantasty, and high adventure.  Having only played a one-shot of Dungeon World, I havn't gotten a chance to fully test the front system yet.  In conversation with Jon Lemich over at [Run a Game](http://www.runagame.net/), he goes as far as to state that Dugeon World and games like it allow a GM to get more bang for their buck out of the time they spend planning if the players are most interested in the narrative aspects of roleplaying games.

In my experience, Dungeons & Dragons required lots of preparation to entertain the Gamism (crunchy rules) gamer.  If the players expect game balance, continuity of rules, and interesting tactical play on the part of the monsters, a GM needs to spend time picking, balancing, and studying the pre-planned encounters of an adventure.  Without this prep D&D games risk total party kills (TPKs), unbalanced encounters whose overall outcome is too easily predetermined failure or success.  D&D adventures often have to have fixed set-pieces for the adventurers to discovery in their explorations which can make a game feel like it is "on rails".  This doesn't mean the GMs and players alike can't be creative within D&amp;D; the rules just don't do much to incentivize it.

## In Summary

Dungeon World is a great gateway game to some different ideas about narrative roleplaying games.  Because of both its familiar similarities and mantifesto appropriate differences to Dungeons & Dragons it will cut straight to the point and help players and GMs discover what kind of games they'd like to play during their gaming sessions.

As a side note, there are a whole wave of more recent "D&D but with more modern rules" out there to explore such as Blades in the Dark and Torchbearer that I am now interested to read.  I might start with Apocalypse World though, to see if that can be adapted for some creative Call of Cthulhu play.
