### 6) The Grizzled

This game struck the perfect balance of tone and mechanics.  The game tells the cooperative story of French soldiers in World War I trying to survive day by day to make it home.  Players take turns pushing their luck trying to take risks in trench warfare to push the objective of playing their hand of cards into a cute but morbit match 3 mechanic of trench warefare horrors.  The game limits communication so one much intuit or deduce the hand of the other players based on their willingness to continue in a hand rather than folding for the day.

I've all but stopped consuming modern war stories as entertainment, but this boardgame treated the subject matter with enough respect that I am looking forward to playing it again.

### 5) Burgle Bros

One part stealth, and one part cooperative puzzle game

Not wanting to play war games doesn't apply to fantastical miniature war games, a.k.a. the "Dudes on a Map" genere.  This year we payed part two of the Matagot fantasy trilogy called Kemet, a civ building take-and-hold war game.  Each 

### 3) Arkham Horror the Card Game

A new genre for me LCG, has a role playing game element to it.  Hits the theme of lovecraftian horror well.  The story and map elements made the randomness not feel to weird for me.  I'm not particularly into deckb building so I appreciate that their are strong example characters.  Playing through missions a second time had some advantage to it as I knew which fork in the room was more dangerous as a whole.

### 2) Flamme Rouge

I love that it's competitive without being violent 

### 1) Dreadball 2nd Edition

Not actually a board game, Dreadball is very much a tabletop miniature sports game. Producer Mantic games makes a line up of clones of popular titles from.  I found the cost of the hobby approachable and was able to join a league of 7 other friends playing a once a league play.  My wife calls it Dwarfball.  It's a combination of fantasy football, pokernight, and Warhammer 40k.
