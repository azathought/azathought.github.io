After a long break, I'm running a D&D game with friends online.  We just finished our 4th weeknight session using the Roll20 app and and I hope very much that we can keep it going in our busy adult lives as I'm having a ton of fun.  

One thing that has always bugged me with Roll20, and most other virtual tabletop tools, is that they use an overhead view of the adventure map. This might have been common in 1990's video games, but ever since Baldur's Gate and Diablo it feels quite awkward to play a computer version of D&D with a top down view. Video Games switched for a reason:  players sitting infront of a table look down at a board game at roughly a 45 degree downward angle. you can see more of the action and the monsters and heroes look much more interesting from the side than from overhead.  Taking up the challenge and inspired by some of the other games and projects I'm seeing out there, I've started to invest some hobby art time in prepping maps and minis to run my game in an alternate mode called isometric.  Here's what I've learned prepping assets a few games ahead for a game of Tomb of Annihilation, a printed adventure book make by the D&D people that involves a dinosaur and zombie infested jungle adventure.

### What is Isometric

[PIC of and isometric map]

Isometric is way of drawing (a 2D practice) of 3D space where height, width, and depth [all have equal measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric). Unlike more realistic 3D art, that means there is no foreshortening, motion paralax, or lense distortion.  This actually makes life easy for old-school 2D sprite artists but can be more difficult for 3D artists who now have to design levels quite differently than true-to life architecture as the camera angle is fixed at a downward 45 degree angle.

### Converting 2D module art into isometric

You can actually convert any flat 2D map into a ground layer of an isometric map by rotating the map 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in an graphics app like Photoshop or Pixelmator and then scaling the vertical dimension by about 58 percent.  Here's an example of a basic map in 2D and then again in an isometric projection.

With a bit of hand drawn work using a stylus or various tools on an iPad, you can add some elements on the height axis to add some depth and points of interest for the players.

I remember to work in layers in my digital editor so that I can later go back and mess with transparency.  If you can, it's always good to be able to see the grid for floor squares where the players may stand.

### Converting Prebought Module Art to Isometric

I've bought the digital copy of the module maps for the Tomb of Annihilation setting.  You get faily good results with just the rotation trick

### Modular isometic dungeon tiles

A really good experience with this patreon

### Sourcing minis in a consistent style


### Drawing and coloring minis 


As much as i'd love to throw down for a new Wacom tablet screen and a copy of photoshop, I'm done paying big money for limited time unitasekrs.  I say limited time because I own a Wacom tablet and the last Adobe Creative suite before they when to a subscription-only model.  Neither work with a modern laptop (Photoshop because of java issues)

Astro pad and Pixelmator to the rescue
