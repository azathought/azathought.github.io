Hobby art to enrich the experience has always been a big part of tabletop role playing.  

Mostly done overhead maps + minis, but you'll notics from images that players don't actually see a top down view of the game.  They see it from sitting height above a table.  Not surprisingly both computer game RPGS (CRPGs) like Baldur's gate and Action RPGS like Diablo take what's known as an isometric view of the table.  

Isometric is different from 3D as there is no foreshortening, paralax, or lense distortion, which make life easy for old-school 2D sprite artists but interestingly more difficult for 3D artists who now have to design levels quite differently than true-to life architecture.

Mayble my interest in this has something to do with Old School Revival gaming (OSR)

### Roll20 and Isometric

I was a kickstarter backer, the tool has improved massively since then.  The makers of the company probably need to educate themselves in some Public Relations basics or at least learn the Thumper rule.

Technically a Hex Grid works, but snapping minis to it never really works.

I turn off the grid.  I try to design knowing the players will step behind things

### Converting 2D module art into isometrics

45 degree rotation
90% horizontal shrink, 52% vertical shrink

[Before] [After]

### The Challenge of occlusion and hallways

video games can make walls transparent when you move behind them.  Roll20 cannot

### Modular Isometic dungeon tiles

A really good experience with this patreon

### Colorizing Isometric minis

The new digital arts analog of painting a miniature

### Converting WOTC content to isometric

It's easy but doesn't entirely match the consistent style

### Custom drawing

As much as i'd love to throw down for a new Wacom tablet screen and a copy of photoshop, I'm done paying big money for limited time unitasekrs.  I say limited time because I own a Wacom tablet and the last Adobe Creative suite before they when to a subscription-only model.  Neither work with a modern laptop (Photoshop because of java issues)

Astro pad and Pixelmator to the rescue
