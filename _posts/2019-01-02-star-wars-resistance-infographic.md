Pilot episodes are tough for character interaction as the main purpose of the show is to set up the protagonist's relationship to others.  Despite having a fun and diverse cast of characters, Disney's newest entry into the [contracting](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/21/17886892/star-wars-release-schedule-disney-bob-iger) Star Wars property unfortunately fails the Bechdel test for it's first episode. Specifically, two named characters who are women do not exchange diaglog about a topic other than a man. With multiple women in the show, this will likely be quickly rectified.

Also, see the [previous diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/Infographic-star-wars-rebels/) for the passing Star Wars Rebels for comparison.
