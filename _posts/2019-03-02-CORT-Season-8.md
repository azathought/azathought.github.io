I'm not a sports person. I have many friends and coworkers who play in a fantasy sports league.  I've never been interested.  In elementary school I had to do both simulated stock market trading and fantasy baseball as class assignments. Ever since getting an F on a 4th grade math assignment because I computed a baseball batting average as a mathematical mean instead of a hit percentage, I wasn't too interested in the tabulatures and statistics of sports much less tracking a sports team over a season.

Fast forward into adult life and I've written software engines to compute official statistics for First-class cricket and have been an official for Women's Roller Derby.  However, I pass on the office fantasy football league every year, I don't bet on March Madness, and as a gamer I havn't even played many sports video games; the 2002 classic [Sega Soccer Slam](https://www.giantbomb.com/sega-soccer-slam/3030-17290/) for the X-Box being a rare exception.  But last year I was invited by a friend to join a local tabletop gaming League for a game called Dreaball and it has been a frustrating, nervewracking, and fantastic time.  

## Why this game rocks

## Taking it too seriously

## My team and season

As the replacement coach, backfilling a friend who moved out of state, I had first pick of sci-fi themed teams.  I chose a slow but tough hitting "sumo lizard" team called the Matsudan.  I played a good defensive game, taking each match to the full 14 rushes and never letting an opponent "7-point" me and invoke the mercy rule.

I ended my regular season one spot out of the playoffs.

I went for a strategy of buying a strong coaching and cheerleader bench rather than saving up for a captain.
