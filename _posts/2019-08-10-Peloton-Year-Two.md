It's been a year since my [post about my DIY Pelton](/diy-peloton/) where, six months after purchase my Peloton Digital setup, I hit the inflection point where my setup became more cost-efficient than the extreme luxury option of a premium spin studio + ride-share transportation. I don't ride that bike as often as I'd like, but a year ago I projected a once a week Peloton ride taking the effective Cost per ride of a home setup below $30 per class. A year later, here's what happened:

Not surprisingly, August 2018 to August 2019 has seen motivation and health issues cause me not to get many rides in. I'm only at 35 total rides and as a result, the effective Cost per Ride (CpR) of my DIY peloton is now $29.84 as opposed to the $15 I would have hit if I was riding weekly. As a result, for my investment in the bike and Peloton Digital subscription I am now under the cost of buying Soul Cycle classes individually. But I've got a while to go before I have significant cost savings.

The **time savings** however, and the flexibility of a home setup for something as simple as a spin bike has been great. In the last year, Peloton added other class types that are not large exercise equipment dependent. So far, I have only tried the Yoga, but if I can find the space and time I might try strength training. The only thing that will drive this Peloton digital subscription to be better is if I use it more. ;P
