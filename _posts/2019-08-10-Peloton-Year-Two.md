It's been a year since my [post about my DIY Pelton](/diy-peloton/) where, six months after purchase my Peloton Digital setup.  Back then was the moment my home bike with a Peloton Digital subscription (the old price) became more cost-efficient than the extreme luxury option of a premium spin studio with ride-share transportation. I don't ride the as often as most, but at the time I projected a once a week Peloton ride taking the effective Cost per ride of a home setup below $30 per class. A year later, here's what happened:

Not surprisingly, August 2018 to August 2019 has seen motivation and health issues cause me not to get many rides in. I'm only at 35 total rides and as a result, the effective Cost per Ride (CpR) of my DIY peloton is now $29.84. I am under the cost of buying Soul Cycle classes individually. But I've got a while to go before I have significant cost savings.

The **time savings** however, and the flexibility of a home setup for something as simple as a spin bike has been great. In the last year, Peloton added other class types that are not large exercise equipment dependent. The only thing that will make this Peloton digital subscription better will be if I use it more. ;P
