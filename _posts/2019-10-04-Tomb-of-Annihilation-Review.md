**Spoiler Warning: This review will have major spoilers for Chapters 1 and 2 of Tomb of Annihilation.** 

I'm excited to say I am a whole year and 21 sessions into running Tomb of Annihilation (TOA) on Roll20 with some good friends.  We are in the middle of a golden age of tabletop role playing games brought forth by a few things
* nostalgia inducing Fifth edition of D&D
* streaming & podcast driven exposure of the hobby
* something about the times we live making games that require eye contact with your friends exciting

This is a review of the published adventure "Tomb of Annihilation" of the main Wizards of the Coast D&D brand, which I decided to use as the basis for my game. If you are looking for a breakdown of the adventure, check out other reviews first.

If you've come interested in my isometric conversion of the module, [check out my previous post on the subject last year](/embracing-isometric-roll20/).  The two most important tips are that you can convert top downmaps to isometric with a two-step transformation in a picture editor and that you should check out [Epic Isometric](https://www.patreon.com/epicisometric/overview) as a way to introduce a consistent visual style to your game.  As it's a derivative work of art and game assets from all over, I'll just say I made it intended for personal use. I encourage folks to support the hobby by buying art packs from artists like [Mike Schley](https://prints.mikeschley.com/p1010232766) and [Epic Isometric](https://www.patreon.com/epicisometric/overview).  The Roll20 and DndBeyond content packs for Tomb of Annihilation are both awesome.

## TL/DR my take up front

This is my favorite published adventure so far in 5th edition. It has it's weaknesses, but the immersive setting and high adventure combined with easy customization make for a fun time for many varieties of gaming groups.  Read below for my pros, cons, and modifications for my table.

## Why I love this adventure

### TOA is a series of non-linear sandbox stages

The game is divided up into 5 chapters each representing a different non-linear section of the story.  Chapter 1 focuses on a port city that can be explored in any order.  Chapter 2 is large jungle map with dozens of sittings worth of content to explore.  Chapter 3 switches into a similar non-liear exploration of lost ruin with multiple factions racing to solve ... well I'm not there yet in my game so we'll keep the spoilers to the first two chapters.

### Nostalgia with flexibility

TOA is an homage to 1st edition D&D down to it's close namesake the [Tomb of Horrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors), hexcrawl style open world exploration, and expectation of high player death.  There is even an optional rule for a "Meat Grinder" difficulty setting.  All of this tickles the current nostalgic desire for old school revival in RPGs without locking GMs out of any innovations or story driven possibilities of more modern games.  

TOA is still flexible enough to suit most styles of play.  Surveys of dozens of games in Facebook groups of GMs running show a high variance of actual player death, which I see as a victory of flexibility to the preferred style of play for different groups.  I've been able to pick and choose ideas from these online communities of GMs running the module and mix them in easily to the broad sandbox style without disrupting or distracting the flow of the game.  Here are a few great ideas inspired/taken from others (sources hard to direct link to)

### It has a great 'destination' setting

The land of Chult is a peninsula south-west of the original "Sword Coast" location of Ed Greenwood Forgotten Realms setting. Forgotten Realms is often called "Kitchen Sink Fantasy," as it makes a place for every possible morsel of D&D content and high magic fantasy trope rather than doing fewer things and doing them well.  I remember when I was hesitant to run a game in the mid 90's because I thought the 10 year old setting had too much lore.  Twenty years later and that has only gotten worse.  The risk of having too much setting back story is that the focus of the game can quickly become about the setting and the NPCs rather than the players themselves and the adventures they are having, especially when some of the players have read the books or played the video games that share the world of the adventure module.

By having the entire adventure take palce in the Dinosaur and Zombie infesed peninsula of Chult, players are removed from their preconceptions of standard Tolkien-ish medieval or proto-renaissance social structures without having to grapple with anything too disorienting.  Chult is high theme, backing up style with substance (Dinosaurs everywhere!). While part of the Forgotten Realms, Chult is a richer and more exciting setting than I'm used to from D&D adventure modules since the heyday of the 2nd edition setting explosion.  

### The encounters are genuinely creative and funny

Less time in TOA is spent exploring thirty room dungeons with little interesting per room and more time is spent on showpiece destinations in the jungle that can be completed in a single night. On top of that, some of the encounters are comic gold.  As and example: scaling the jungle pyramid Orolunga has a hilarious skill challenge (remember those?) that encourages acting on the part of the players and is all but garaunteed to break the table into uncontrollable laughter. As another example, Firefinger is a grand vertically stacked dungeon and truly fun to explore.  The set piece battle against the Pterafolk (evil huminoid pteradactyles) high above the jungle carries the real risk of PCS being thrown hundreds of feet below to their deaths.  Many such set piece battles in fun locations are the kinds of things players remember.

## Weak points of the adventure

Some of these are real weaknesses.  Making a published adventure is always difficult as it has to sell to the broad spectrum of gamers and account for every possible play style and character back story.  These are my criticism, read below to see how I adapted the first year of my TOA game to adjust.

### Like most published modules it has a weak start

The hardest thing for a published adventure is to make a captivating start that will appeal to all possible permuations of groups and character motivations.  TOA starts with exposition about the death curse and an infected quest giver followed shortly by a teleportation to the only remaining civilized outpost in Chult.  The game introduces a somewhat empathetic character and the ticking clock of her demise to encourage forward motion in the story.  It works, but I highly recommend having the players tie their character backgrounds more firmly in self-written plot hooks to explain why they would dare risk it all on this quest.

### It's a mystery without good clues

The first two chapters are set up as an exploration and mystery, where the PCs have to discover the source of an evil Curse knowing only that the answer lies somewhere in Chult.  They have to first discovery that the answer to the mystery lies in the lost city of Omu and then discovery the location of Omu.  The NPCs and quest givers push the players towards locations and scenaros where the players can uncover more exposition that just tells them the answers to the above two questions.  Diagramming the actual solution shows how expository andflimsy mystery adventures can be in D&D.  There are very few links and missing a search role is all it takes for a months worth of exploring to miss an important 'clue'.

I highly recommend GMs read a Gumshoe based RPG book like [Trail of Cthulhu](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/trail-of-cthulhu/) to get ideas on how to improve the narrative flow of mystery adventures in RPGs.  Finding important clues that form the critical path **have** to be automatic if the players follow the trail of clues.  Interpreting the clues should be the challenge instead of the rolls.  Rolling well should expose extra information that enriches the story and immersion, giving payers extra info that will help them stay alive on the next leg of the trail of clues.  The trail should be non-linear, with multiple possible paths and enough loose hooks to help a GM improvise paths mid-game.  I'll detail how I planned my Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 myster path.

### Too many NPCs in combat

Much like [Out of the Abyss](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/outoftheabyss), players in TOA have the opportunity to meet many NPCs who are willing to join the party and take part in battles.  The problem is that every additional NPC and ballancing extra monster adds more actions economy and characters into the initiative role.  4 players a 4 monsters taking 1 mintue each to resolve combat actions takes 40 minutes to finish a 5 round combat.  A 4 player group with 2 NPCs in tow, facing a slightly harder group of more numerous and tougher monsters (let's say it's 5 monsters) now takes 55 minutes to resolve the same fight.  Some of the NPCs are well written, adding flavor and context to the world.  Others are D&D lore fan service, cameos pulled straight out of a different D&D product.  If a GM isn't careful, the spotlight can quickly fall on these NPCs who are powerful enough to become the dreaded GM-PC.

### Is Chult post-Colonial Africa?

A much better writeup of issues some have with TOA with regards to black depictions in Chult can be found in [this Kotaku article](https://kotaku.com/dungeons-dragons-stumbles-with-its-revision-of-the-ga-1819657235)

Given that the setting of the game presents a post-colonial Nyanzaru and a penninsula of dark skinned people with fantasy African inspirations, DMs running this adventure should have some awareness of possible reactions from their players. A game of make believe for both children and adults, I'd encourage GMs to have open comminication with their players on the topic and to adjust, remove, or emphasize the parts of the module that make it more fun or interesting to them.

Wizards of the Coast has done an excellent job diversifying many aspects of their game and promoting an inclusive hobby, but it doesn't change the fact we live in hyper sensitive times. GMs should adjust for their table as necessary but I believe it is worth calling attention to it. I'm glad I saw the above article before reading so I could make some adjustments to improve the immersion and enjoyment of my table.

## Modifications

I'll quickly go over some of the changes I made to Chapter 1 and 2 of TOA

### Altering Chult

Dinosaur Island

### Shipwreck start

Start on the boat with the dragon turtle
A source for replacement characters
Everyone made a choice to get on the boat, have players explain why they are headed to the island
A simple "story mode" encounter and then a simple kobold dungeon to get new players to learn their characters
A 20 to 30 mile trip through the jungle without supplies to foreshadow how hard the jungle is withotu a guide or supplies encourages players to talk to the guides in Nyanzaru to reveal plot hooks.

### Pacing in the Jungle Grind

After first experience with jungle, make a bigger point of first foray into the wilderness.  After that all additional time spent on logistics of survival get boring, switch to not getting lost first time they leave the river.  After that is no longer fun, make the encounters more interesting.  Have one last boss fight before hitting 5th level.  At that point the players are more than a match for the jungle and you should be focused only on the mystery and major encounters.  

### Mysteries need Clues, not exposition

GM gives Clues, players roll and role play for more details and context
Here is my plot outline


### The Aldani Map Puzzle

Inspired by the map room in the first Indiana Jones movie, I made a puzzle the PCs could follow to get the general area where Omu is located. They knew at this point from the Sage of Orolunga that the lost city of Omu was where they were looking with the following clue:

> "A wizard from the land of lakes, a survivor of 5 iterations of the universe, built a tomb in the lost city of Omu. Within it he hides the engine of undeath you seek."

Not making it too easy, the Sage tells the party that Omu is hidden from her eyes. It's shielded from all scrying and directions to it are removed from the memories of all living beings. They'll have to find it through some old school archeology!

Inete has been having dreams of red wizards in the Aldani Basin. If the payers explore that they find a Red Wizard encounter with their entourage of guards and skeletons studying 4 ancient standing stones or pillars. They are marked with glyphs depicting 1. pyramid, 2. heart 3. garden and 4. Omu. 

{% include image.html url="posts/2019-10-04-toar-puzzle.jpg" description="Game 5" caption="Game 5: Firefinger converted to isometric" %}

The arrangement of the pillars reveals the approximate location of Omu as long as you can piece together from your explorations that 1 is Orolunga, 2 is the heart of Ubtao, and 3 is Nangalore.  One of the pictures above is the battle map with the pillars. I copy and pasted it to the actual player's map of Chult in Roll20 so that week to week the players could use it as a reference when guessing Omu's location.
