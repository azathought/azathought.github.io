**Spoiler Warning: This review will have major spoilers for Chapters 1 and 2 of Tomb of Annihilation.** 

I'm excited to say I am a whole year and 21 sessions into running Tomb of Annihilation (TOA) on Roll20 with some good friends.  We are in the middle of a golden age of tabletop role playing games brought forth by a few things
* nostalgia inducing Fifth edition of D&D
* streaming & podcast driven exposure of the hobby
* something about the times we live making games that require eye contact with your friends exciting

This is a review of the published adventure "Tomb of Annihilation" of the main Wizards of the Coast D&D brand, which I decided to use as the basis for my game. If you are looking for a breakdown of the adventure, check out other reviews first.

If you've come interested in my isometric conversion of the module, [check out my previous post on the subject last year](/embracing-isometric-roll20/).  The two most important tips are that you can convert top downmaps to isometric with a two-step transformation in a picture editor and that you should check out [Epic Isometric](https://www.patreon.com/epicisometric/overview) as a way to introduce a consistent visual style to your game.  As it's a derivative work of art and game assets from all over, I'll just say I made it intended for personal use. I encourage folks to support the hobby by buying art packs from artists like [Mike Schley](https://prints.mikeschley.com/p1010232766) and [Epic Isometric](https://www.patreon.com/epicisometric/overview).  The Roll20 and DndBeyond content packs for Tomb of Annihilation are both awesome.

## Conclusion up Front

This is my favorite published adventure so far in 5th edition. It has it's weaknesses, but the immersive setting and high adventure combined with easy customization make for a fun time for many varieties of gaming groups.

## Why I love this adventure

### It has a series of sandbox maps to explore in a non-linear way

The game is divided up into 5 chapters each representing a different non-linear section of the story.  Chapter 1 focuses on a port city that can be explored in any order.  Chapter 2 is large jungle map with dozens of games worth of content to explore.  Chapter 3 switches into a similar non-liear exploration of lost ruin with multiple factions racing to solve ... well I'm not there yet in my game so we'll keep the spoilers to the first two chapters.

### Nostalgia with flexibility

TOA is an homage to 1st edition D&D down to it's close namesake the [Tomb of Horrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors), hexcrawl style open world exploration, and expectation of high player death.  There is even an optional rule for a "Meat Grinder" difficulty setting.  All of this tingles the current set of nostalgia of the old school revival without locking GMs out of any innovations or story driven possibilities of more modern games.  TOA is still flexible enough to suit most styles of play.  Surveys of dozens of games in Facebook groups of GMs running show a high variance of actual player death, which I see as a victory of flexibility to the preferred style of play for different groups.  I've been able to pick and choose ideas from these online communities of GMs running TOA and mix them in easily to the broad sandbox style without disrupting or distracting the flow of the game.  Here are a few great ideas inspired/taken from others (sources hard to direct link to)

* The dreaded Macawbear (it's an owl bear with macaw plumage)
* The Aldani rap battle: From Facebook: the lobster people of the aldani basin only negotiate in rhyming rap duels
* Skeleton outpost: from Adam Kobel's (not sure where he got it) Roll20 Presents stream, and outpost of undead soldiers who don't know they are undead.
* [The Library of Kir Sabal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tombofannihilation/comments/a4zkhw/kir_sabal_asharras_library/): from reddit, the contents of Asharra's library


### It has a great 'destination' setting

The land of Chult is a peninsula south-west of the original "Sword Coast" location of Ed Greenwood Forgotten Realms setting. Forgotten Realms is often called "Kitchen Sink Fantasy," as it lacks focus preferring to make a place for every possible morsel of D&D content rather than doing fewer things and doing them well.  I remember when I was hesitant to run a game in the mid 90's when I thought the 10 year old setting had too much lore.  Twenty years later and that has only gotten worse.  The risk of having too much setting back story is that the focus of the game can quickly become about the setting and the NPCs rather than the players themselves and the adventures they are having, especially when some of the players have read the books or played the video games the share the world of the adventure module.

By having the entire adventure take palce in the Dinosaur and Zombie infesed peninsula of Chult, players are removed from their preconceptions of standard Tolkien-ish medieval or proto-renaissance social structures without having to grapple with anything too disorienting.  Chult is high theme, backing up style with substance (Dinosaurs everywhere!). While part of the Forgotten Realms, Chult is a richer and more exciting setting than I'm used to from D&D adventure modules since the heyday of the 2nd edition setting explosion.  

### The encounters are genuinely creative and funny

Less time in TOA is spent exploring thirty room dungeons with little interesting per room and more time is spent on showpiece destinations in the jungle that can be completed in a single night. On top of that, some of the encounters are comic gold.  As and example: scaling the jungle pyramid Orolunga has a hilarious skill challenge (remember those?) that encourages acting on the part of the players and is all but garaunteed to break the table into uncontrollable laughter. As another example, Firefinger is a grand vertically stacked dungeon and truly fun to explore.  The set piece battle against the Pterafolk (evil huminoid pteradactyles) high above the jungle carries the real risk of PCS being thrown hundreds of feet below to their deaths.  Many such set piece battles in fun locations are the kinds of things players remember.

## Weak points of the adventure

Some of these are real weaknesses.  Making a published adventure is always difficult as it has to sell to the broad spectrum of gamers and account for every possible play style and character back story.  These are my criticism, read below to see how I adapted the first year of my TOA game to adjust.

### Like most published modules it has a weak start

The hardest thing for a published adventure is to make a captivating start that will appeal to all possible permuations of groups and character motivations.  TOA starts with exposition about the death curse and an infected quest giver followed shortly by a teleportation to the only remaining civilized outpost in Chult.  The game introduces an somewhat empathetic character and a ticking clock of her demise to encourage forward motion in the story.  It works, but I highly recommend having the players tie their character backgrounds more firmly in self-written plot hooks to explain why they would dare risk it all on this quest.

### It's a mystery without good clues

The first two chapters are set up as an exploration and mystery, where the PCs have to discover the source of an evil Curse knowing only that the answer lies somewhere in Chult.  They have to first discovery that the answer to the mystery lies in the lost city of Omu and then discovery the location of Omu.  The NPCs and quest givers push the players towards locations and scenaros where the players can uncover more exposition that just tells them the answers to the above two questions.  Diagramming the actual solution shows how expository andflimsy mystery adventures can be in D&D.  There are very few links and missing a search role is all it takes for a months worth of exploring to miss an important 'clue'.

I highly recommend GMs read a Gumshoe based RPG book like [Trail of Cthulhu](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/trail-of-cthulhu/) to get ideas on how to improve the narrative flow of mystery adventures in RPGs.  Finding important clues that form the critical path **have** to be automatic if the players follow the trail of clues.  Interpreting the clues should be the challenge instead of the rolls.  Rolling well should expose extra information that enriches the story and immersion, giving payers extra info that will help them stay alive on the next leg of the trail of clues.  The trail should be non-linear, with multiple possible paths and enough loose hooks to help a GM improvise paths mid-game.  I'll detail how I planned my Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 myster path.

### Too many NPCs in combat

Much like [Out of the Abyss](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/outoftheabyss), players in TOA have the opportunity to meet many NPCs who are willing to join the party and take part in battles.  The problem is that every additional NPC and ballancing extra monster adds more actions economy and characters into the initiative role.  4 players a 4 monsters taking 1 mintue each to resolve combat actions takes 40 minutes to finish a 5 round combat.  A 4 player group with 2 NPCs in tow, facing a slightly harder group of more numerous and tougher monsters (let's say it's 5 monsters) now takes 55 minutes to resolve the same fight.  Some of the NPCs are well written, adding flavor and context to the world.  Others are D&D lore fan service, cameos pulled straight out of a different D&D product.  If a GM isn't careful, the spotlight can quickly fall on these NPCs who are powerful enough to become the dreaded GM-PC.

### Is Chult post-Colonial Africa?

This adventure is pure pulp fiction. The same kind of high adventure in exotic far away lands as Tarzan, Conan, Indiana Jones, and other properties that continue to tap into this genre that had it's heyday in the frist half of the 20th century.  Chult, with it's dark skinned people and many African styled names and depictions is easily seen as a fantasy Africa where the primary Forgrotten Realms Sword Coast can be seen as a renaissance merchant-civilization dominated Europe.  That makes Chult and TOA the most prominent depiction of black characters in D&D in recent memory if not ever.  While the characters are varied, it is getting harder to justify playing a game in 2019 where PCs explore into what is effectively a "dark continent" devoid of people and population.  This is too close to the depiction of Africa in western eyes from before World War II.  

In the story, the civilized Port Nyanzaru is rules by a cabal of Merchant Princes who have manipulated their way free of Colonial rule by a different nation called Amn (of which I personally know very little.  It is south of Baldur's Gate).  They use their great wealth to hire mercenaries to protect their monopolies on lucrative trade in the Pror
