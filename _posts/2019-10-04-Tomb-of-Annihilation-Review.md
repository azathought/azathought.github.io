I'm excited to say I am a whole year and 21 sessions into running Tomb of Annihilation on Roll20 with some good friends.  We are in the middle of a golden age of tabletop role playing games brought forth by a nostalgia inducing Fifth edition of D&D, streaming & podcast driven exposure of the hobby, and something about the times we live in making games that require eye contact and a lack of anonymity refreshing.

This is a review of the published adventure Tomb of Annihilation, which I decided to use as the basis for my game.  [I've written about converting many of the game assets to an Isometric art perspecitve in Roll20](/embracing-isometric-roll20/).  The two most important tips are that you can convert top downmaps to isometric with a two-step transformation in a picture editor and that you should check out [Epic Isometric](https://www.patreon.com/epicisometric/overview) as a way to introduce a consistent visual style to your game.

## Why I love this adventure

### It's a nostalgic throw back
### It has a series of sandbox maps to explore in a non-linear way
### It has a great 'destination' setting

## Weak points of the adventure

### It's a mystery without good clues
### Like most published modules it has a weak start
### Too many NPCs in combat
### Cameos that don't serve the story
### Are we mature enough to play a game that touches on Colonialism?
### Representation and Depiction matter

## Modifications

### Shipwreck start
### Dangerous Jungle, Watch for the Grind
### Mysteries need Clues, not exposition
### Altering Chult
### I'm tired of Hags
### Converting NPCs into Companions

Forgotten Realms is boring.  Jumping to a far flung setting is exciting but can easily
