A continued journal of Week 2 from the Social Distancing zone of Washington DC.  

This week the news started getting dire as our hospitals and healthcare workers are getting hit hard by the pandemic. This is also the week that things started getting more stressful. Getting accurate information is quite difficult and I am trying to making sure not to get overwhelmed by hearsay and rumor.  However, the partial testing and seven-day delay on results create a pretty big gap between the number of confirmed cases in the US vs. our likely actual cases and daily transmission rates.  Social distancing and staying at home seem appropriate, and possibly not enough.

# The very beginnings of scarcity

As Americans, we are not used in the slightest to scarcity. If I was able to send a letter to my past self from a month ago it would say:

* Buy 2 big packs of toilet paper
* Buy 2 big packs of paper towels
* Buy dry yeast packets so that I can make pizza from home
* Buy an enormous dispenser of hand sanitizer and 4 small bottles
* Buy 2 x 32 oz 99% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol
* Buy 25 lb and 35 lb kettlebells
* Consider buying a deep freeze chest for the basement

# Things I did this week that I would not normally do

* Sanitized my doorbell
* Filled up my car with gas when it is already 80% full
* Backed out of running an online D&D game for the local community
* Many zoom happy hours

# Zoom socializing

As a six-year work-from-home veteran, it is humorous to see the rest of the world telling the same work from home jokes for the first time. Seeing people discovery "Brady Bunch-mode", the mute button, and being ready to be off of zoom on the weekend is somewhat amusing.

# Am I taking this seriously enough?

Given that testing is only partial and there is a seven-day delay for test results in my area, the actual numbers of transmissions and infected compared to what is being tracked as confirmed cases officially are going to be at least an order of magnitude off.  This week I left my house for three things:

* Getting supplies from the grocery store.
* Running in my neighborhood.  
* Visiting my local bar for a weekly pick-up order. 

I'm torn on whether I should be doing the third one when I have plenty of food at home.
