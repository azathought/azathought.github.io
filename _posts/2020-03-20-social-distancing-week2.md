A continued journal of Week 2 from the Social Distancing zone of Washington DC.

If my past self from a month ago got a letter from me today it would say:
Buy 1 big thing of toilet paper
Buy 1 big thing of paper towels
Buy a enormous thing of hand sanitizer and 4 small bottles
Buy 2 x 32 oz 99% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol
Buy a kettle bell
Break down more chicken thighs and freeze to eat as dinners

Have a deep freeze chest in the basement


Fixating on the wrong things: 
* how bad pneumonia would be
* That even isopropfyl alcohol is sold out
* how difficult it is to buy a kettlebell right now

Things I did I would not normally do
* sanitized my door bell
* Filled up my car with gas
