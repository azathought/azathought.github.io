Social distancing continues for week 5 in Washington DC. Zoom reunions, family dinners, and a surprise milestone birthday for my partner were highlights of the week.  

Pizza is becoming a fascination and obsession of this quarantine for me. I might not be 100% offsetting the impact of all this pizza with Crossfit, but if I exit quarantine with a greater aptitude of making homemade pizza, so be it.  

# Fancy Toaster Pizza

This is where I started for homemade pizza.  Store-bought dough or flatbreads toasted on a BBQ with toppings.  My goal is to improve my skills weekly until I can make a homemade pie I am proud of.

# First Attempt at Sheet Pan Pizza

After watching at least three hours of video about making a sourdough starter, I was able to source dry active yeast. Following a Deb Perelman recipe for same-day dough and using a stand mixer for the first time in my life, I made dough and let it rise in a previously warmed oven.  I then attempted a sheet pan pizza, mostly for the easy cleanup, using a [bon appetite youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5bYP2NlAf4). The result was ... well, it was a tasty charred failure.  As a non-baker, I am seriously underappreciating the attention to the dough recipe in volume, wetness, and time in the oven.  I'll need to find a dough recipe and preparation that match.

# There will be pizza

Oh yes, there will be pizza. The good news is that both Little Cocos and Timber are still open for supplying pizza needs quickly should/when I mess up.
