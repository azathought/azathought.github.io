**Spoiler Warning: This review will have major spoilers for Chapters 5 of Tomb of Annihilation.**

The deed is done. It took 24 months "irl" to play 52 games of 2 hours each, but I completed the Tomb of Annihilation with five dedicated players. This was my first completed run-through of a Wizards of the Coast 5e module and I had a blast. Chapter 5 started for us when the pandemic lockdown set in, and this dungeon crawl became our weekly normal.  While everthing else in life had to adjust, our Roll20 + Zoom D&D game was already good to go **unmodified**. Previous installations of this review in [part 1](/Tomb-of-Annihilation-Review/) and [part 2](/toa2/) introduced pros and cons, and I'll continue that here along with some general tips.

# Con: Problematic Logic for the existence of the Tomb
TODO -- read what the book actually says

From how the adventure is written it seems like Acererak both wants to keep adventurers out of the Tomb but also make it IRRESISTAZBLE.  It's full of treasures but it's entrance is also guarded by shrines, a city of Yuan-it, 

From the lore, it seems the purpose is to hold the spirits of nine slain minor god spirits as well as holding treasures acereak has collected from across the multi-verse.

Dugeon has the purpose of hiding his project
it's hard to find, and even harder to get into with shrine puzzles and a yuan-ti city guarding it
The yuan-ti both guard it and throw adventurers into 

Remind me again why this dungeon exists. Acereak currently uses the dungeon to hide his Lich Maker Monthly experiement Atropal and Sould Monger project. Before that he created the Tomb as yet another puzzle dungeon to contain treasures and attract adventurers, but for what logical purpose? Eveidently, something in the 70's in Lake Geneva required a deadly dungeon for a tournament, but if your. Create death trap dungeon, populate with one of a kind treasures.  --> hard to get in
Dungeon feeds Acererak's phylactery with adventurer souls, TPKs are afterall the most potent source of energy in the multiverse.
  Then why is it so hard to get in the dungeon?
Hide Soulmonger in a city protected from scrying in a dungeon that is hard to get into.  Tell Ras Nsi to protect it
  The why do the Yuan-Ti like throwing people in the dungeon?

# Pacing an Endurance Dungeon
  ## Completionist PCs? 
    Once the PCs figure out not all rooms have treasures will they skip rooms without sarcophogi
  ## Make Long rests matter beyond just getting interrupted
    The Hags' nightmare haunting power can create a ticking clock for the players in the tomb. 
    50 temp hp in final fight will offset this just fine
  ## Make it clear the Trickster gods intend to help the players defeat Acererak
    It gives them a reason to search out the tombs above and beyond the magic items
    

# Discussion of save-or-die traps
## Don't hide the save or die traps
  foreshadow their danger
  describe their obvious danger
  have them spring based on player's actions
## Allow improv on how one could disarming a trap. 
  I need to remember "Yes, and" on two scenarios 
  Creativity still requires a DC 10 or DC 15 roll
  Failing to disarm a trap could have consequences
## Be aware of the match behind save-or die traps
  At what point do saving throws just seem not fair?
      DC 15 vs DC 20
      Remember that inspiration aka Advantage only helps when you were close to 50/50 on a save
      DC 20's are brutal
## The main purpose of traps
  Endurance, a way to drain their resources prior to big fights of the dungeon

# The big fights of the dungeon
## Withers and the Tomb Guardians
  Withers is vulnerable on his own
## Beholder
  The beholder has been observing the party for the entire level of the tomb.  Should know their stengths and weaknesses for saves
  Running combat against an invisible flying foe
## Slaad
  Getting surprise, the invisible monster who can hold his own in melee



# Pacing the tomb
## Pushing back on long rests
## Most skip-able encounters in the Tomb
  Golden Mastadon, Mirror Tomb, Yakka
## Secret door fudging
  The players need to find the Ace warning plaque before hitting up back room tunnels

# Modifying encounters
## Withers is a push over
## Drop magical items

# Beholder tactics
## What does the Beholder know?

The Pro's and Cons of non-linear Dungeon-exploration
* Should you fudge 
* Secret Doors and how to find them, how to fudge them

The relative lethality of a dungeon trap
  How much worse is a DC 20 save than a DC 15 Save?
  Does advantage even help on a DC 20 save?
  Chance of shaking off a DC 20 save status effect
  Status effects you can't shake

Tomb Challenges I Skipped

Tomb Challenges I modified

Behind the scenes in the Dugeon: withers

So many heads, so many voices
* Staying organized
* pick cartoon or celebrity voices that you can quickly turn to
*   Wongo - lauging, crazy monkey, gravel voice, "you and me buddy he he"
*   Moa - whispering snake, "trust me", that person is
*   Nang Nang - evil Yoda
*   Papzotl - 
*   Obo'laka - 
*   Unk - 
*   Shagambi - 
*   I'jin - high pitched?
*   Kubazan - Macho Man Randy Savage



Dealing with Random - you should improvise either during success or failure

Does Acererak break the fourth wall
* bunny slippers and coffee

The Final Fight
* is what everyone wants to talk about
* how much meta-game to put into an epic level sorc fight
* how much cheese to insert into how Arererak fights (careful for nerfed cheese)
* alt spell lists for acererak

Epilogues
