⬇[\[Download\] Pack 2: OpenForge Tile Renders](http://bit.ly/azathought-iso-openforge)⬇

Includes:
* Blender Render of OpenForge 2.0 basic tiles
* transparent png isometric grid at 64 px size
* 2 asset sheets - walls+floor, stairs
* separated assets
* example psd composite

## How to use:
Either using the lasso tool on the asset sheets, or by dragging from the separated assets, build your terrain in a photo editor like Photoshop or GIMP using layers.  Build from top to bottom or arrange the layer order so that tiles near the bottom of the screen occlude the tiles above them.  Tint in photo tool and then add more isometric props.  Finally, avoid complex lighting in your base layer, just export to a compressed JPG of reasonable file size. Add lighting in your VTT.
