## Inspiration
This pack is an alternate finale from Dragon of Icespire Peak, which is the module inside the D&D 5e Essentials Kit boxed set. In the standard module the players may have a final showdown with Cryovain the white dragon on a mountain top fortress. In my underwater and pirate-themed game, I relocated Cryovain's lair to a fortress on an earthmote hovering over a whirlpool into an infitine abyss. This is meant as an epic boss battle, so I spent a bunch of time modelling, texturing the castle. The water simulation turned out pretty well.
