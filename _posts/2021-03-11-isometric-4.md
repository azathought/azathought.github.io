## Inspiration
This pack is my take on the Monastery of the Distressed Body from D&D adventure: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish (LLOK). [D&D Beyond link](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/llok).  In the adventure this is a floating space ship or somthing, but since my game has already had a crashed space ship, I reskinned it to be a strange temple on an island in the middle of a lava cavern inside a volcano.

Also included with the pack is a token option for Ctenmiir, the robotic coffin.
