⬇[\[Download\] Pack 5: Token Collection 1](http://bit.ly/azathought_iso_tokens_1)⬇

Includes:
50+ Hand drawn Isometric Tokens from my previous and current campaign

## Inspiration
I use the heck out of patreon art, HeroForge, and other sources to speed up my game prep. But every once in a while I find I need to bust out a drawing pad (iPad Pro + Procreate) and just draw the character I have in my mind. I'm not an artist, so these don't always mix in well with other art, but it gets the job done. Some of these are rough sketches (gnomes) others I'm very proud of (beholders)  Any way about it, enjoy!
