# Isometric

*This page is a work in progress*

I'm starting a landing page to capture my isometric guides and assets in one place rather than across a dozen youtube videos and lists.  Hi! I'm azathought and I love hacking/making isometric art for my online D&D games. It all started when I converted a Tomb of Annihilation jungle crawl to isometric and we had a magical moment fighting off a Zombie T-Rex rather than fleeing. This moment cemented my love of isometric play, and I'm nto sure I could go back.

My tools and approaches have changed over the years, and I started making videos to answer questions from others on how I was making my game look this way.  Use this page as a reference for tips, tricks, and assets if you you too want to play rpgs online using isometric art.

## Azathought Isometric Content Releases
I decided not to start a patreon. I don't want my hobby turning into an obligation, so I'll just post links to my most recent content packs here:
