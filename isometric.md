# Isometric

*This page is a work in progress*

I'm starting a landing page to capture my isometric guides and assets in one place rather than across a dozen youtube videos and lists.  Hi! I'm azathought and I love hacking/making isometric art for my online D&D games. It all started when I converted a Tomb of Annihilation jungle crawl to isometric and we had a magical moment fighting off a Zombie T-Rex rather than fleeing. This moment cemented my love of isometric play, and I'm not sure I could go back.

My tools and approaches have changed over the years and at some point I started making videos to answer questions from others on how I was making my game look this way.  Use this page as a reference for tips, tricks, and assets if you you too want to play tabletop  online using isometric art.

## Azathought Isometric Content Releases
I decided not to start a Patreon. I don't want my hobby turning into an obligation, so I'll just post links to my content packs here:
* [Isometic Pack 1: 64 px Isometric Template](/isometric-pack-1/)

## Where to follow me
* [Azathought on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/azathought-games)
* [Azathought on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/azathought_games/)

## Isometric in Roll20
I ran in "gridless" moving and sizing tokens freely.  Find my settings for maps imported into Roll20 in Content pack 1.

## Isometric in Foundry VTT
Without special modules, I currently run in a Hex Columns Odd 74 px format, which lines up with a 64 px isometric grid.

Alternatively I've started to run with  the grape_juice-isometics plugin which is currently in early access available through this [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/foundry_grape_juice)
