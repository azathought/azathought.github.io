# Isometric Virtual Table Top Guide

*This page is a work in progress*

I'm starting this landing page to collect isometric guides and assets in one place.  Hi! I'm AZATHOUGHT and I love hacking/making isometric art for my online D&D games. It all started when I converted a Tomb of Annihilation jungle crawl to isometric and my table had a magical moment fighting off a Zombie T-Rex rather than fleeing from it. The players used the vertical terrain! This moment cemented my love of isometric play, and I'm not sure I could go back to traditional "top down" online play.

My tools and techniques have changed over the years and at some point I started making videos to answer questions from others on how I was making my game look this way.  Use this page as a reference for tips, tricks, and assets if you you too want to play tabletop  online using isometric art.

## Isometric in Foundry VTT
Method 1: without special modules, run your grid in a Hex Columns Odd 74 px format. This lines up with a 64 px isometric grid.

Method 2: for full isometric grid support check out the grape_juice-isometics plugin which is currently in early access available through this [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/foundry_grape_juice)

Find full settings for maps imported into Foundry VTT in Content pack 1.

## Isometric in Roll20
I find Roll20 works the best running in "gridless" mode and moving your tokens freely.  Find my settings for maps imported into Roll20 in Content pack 1. Measurements will be approximate, but Roll20 handles gridless well.
